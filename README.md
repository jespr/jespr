### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm Jesper (yes-per), a Ruby on Rails developer that loves building things for users. Even though I prefer Rails, I don't shy away from React at all.

Here's a few of the things I'm currently working on:

Here's a link to my [personal blog](https://www.jesper.dev) and you can find me on Twitter [@jespr](https://twitter.com/jespr)
